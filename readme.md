  <b>a new, tiny, and fast, markdown parser <br> written in TypeScript under the unified umbrella</br></b>
</p>

## What’s micromark

Something like [remark][] (markdown processor powered by plugins based on
[unified][]), but on a lower level: a [lexer][] (in nerdy terms 🤓).
Syntax trees have many good things, but they do come with the downside of
having a big memory footprint and sometimes being more than what you need.

**We’re launching micromark as just an idea.
The first line of code still needs to be written.
But we imagine it to be**:

*   **small** in file size, max 10 kB minzipped, and tiny in memory use
*   **fast** in speed, compared to existing parsers on real world documents
*   **safe** to use, it should safely work on untrusted content by default
*   **compliant** to CommonMark but **extendible** for GFM (GitHub Flavored
    Markdown), MDX, etc.
*   **complete**, in that it should give access to all info in the source
    document

_But it’s not:_

*   something that creates HTML and the like: other projects use micromark for
    that
*   something that creates a syntax tree: remark will use it to do just that

## How it’ll be used

**micromark will be part of [unified][]**.
But it will likely not be something you’d directly interact with, unless
you’re interested in working on parsers, but it will make high-level tooling
better.

Evolving unified shouldn’t just be about new high-level features but also about
rethinking core mechanisms.
**That’s where micromark comes in, so unified can build the most friendly, secure,
fast, and extensive bridges between content formats.**
